# Python Exercises
This repository holds a collection of small exercises and mini-projects designed to sharpen fundamental Python programming skills. The projects showcase manipulation of core data structures and key syntax constructs.

## Project Structure
- `README.md` — project overview (this file)  
- `scripts/` — `.py` files with practice exercises 
- `results/` — markdown files with code outputs
- `LICENSE` — MIT license
- `.gitignore` — excludes temporary and environment-specific files

## How to Use
You can try the exercises in two ways:

### Option 1 — Online (easiest)
No setup needed — just copy any script from the `scripts/` folder and run it in a browser using  
 [Programiz Online Python Compiler](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/)  
or any similar tool.

### Option 2 — Locally (if you already have Python)
If Python is installed, you can:
1. Download or clone this repository  
2. Open the `scripts/` folder  
3. Run a file from your terminal or IDE (like PyCharm or VS Code)

Example:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:OlhaZ-dev/python-exercises.git
cd python-exercises/scripts
python your_script_name.py
